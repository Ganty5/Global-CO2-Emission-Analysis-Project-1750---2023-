**Global CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Analysis Dashboard Project** üåç

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global CO‚ÇÇ emissions, showcasing trends, key contributors, and emission growth rates across various time periods. 
The dashboard is fully interactive, built using Power BI, with data preparation handled in SQL and Power Query. The dataset used to realize this project was gotten 
from the official Data in our world website. Using the information and the insight generated from this dataset, we can easily see countries in the planet who tend 
to contribute most to the emission of carbon dioxide and thus allocated the best strategy and measures to enhance a safer environment and home for all, saving livestocks 
and human lives.

**Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize historical CO‚ÇÇ emission trends, identify major emitters, and provide insights into climate change impacts. 
The project integrates multiple datasets and features advanced data modeling and visualization. Inisghts from this data will guild decision-making and optimize choices.


**Project Workflow**
1. Data Preparation (SQL)
I Cleaned, transformed, and analyzed raw emission datasets using SQL. Performed operations such as filtering, aggregating, and handling missing values.
Saved the processed tables for further integration.
2. Data Integration (Power Query)
Imported and merged multiple dataset tables in Power BI using Power Query Editor. Established relationships between tables based on common fields like Entity and Year.
Applied joins to create a unified dataset for visualization.
3. Dashboard Development (Power BI)
The following visuals were created on the dashboard:

Line Chart: Global CO‚ÇÇ emission over the years.
Stacked Area Chart: Cumulative emissions of top contributing countries.
Bar Chart: Total emissions by entity.
Pie Chart: Top 10 emitters' share of emissions.
Map Visual: Geographic locations of top emitters.
Filters: Interactive slicers for Year and Entity to dynamically update all visuals.

**Features**
Interactive filters and slicers for real-time data exploration.
Visualizations of key emission metrics, including:
Total emissions across all entities.
Emission growth rate trends.
Cumulative contribution of top emitters.
I focused on usability and data-driven insights.

**Technologies Used**
SQL: For data cleaning and preparation.
Power BI: For data integration, modeling, and visualization.
Power Query: For merging and transforming data tables.
